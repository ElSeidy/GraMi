GraMi
=====

GraMi is a novel framework for frequent subgraph mining in a single large  graph, GraMi outperforms existing techniques by 2 orders of magnitudes. GraMi  supports finding frequent subgraphs as well as frequent patterns, Compared to subgraphs, patterns offer a more powerful version of matching that captures  transitive interactions between graph nodes (like friend of a friend) which are very common in modern applications. Also, GraMi supports user-defined  structural and semantic constraints over the results, as well as approximate results.
